#Test Automation

###What is Automation?

Automation, in its simplest form, is the mechanization of a manual process that allows for that process to operate automatically. There are many applications 
of automation, and there are many ways in which we can test. Using automation allows us to mechanize an otherwise manual process for testing. There are many 
additional uses for automation, that are not specifically for testing, that can be performed with automated test tools. Examples of these may include pre-test 
activities such as creating user accounts and building data sets, which will ultimately be used in automated testing. Functional and regression test activities 
are those most  frequently targeted for the use of automated testing. Additional uses for automation of tests include API testing, performance testing, security 
testing, and automation of test management activities.

###Automation in Software Lifecycle Methodologies

Software development methodologies are evolving from traditional Waterfall to more recent Agile approaches. Testing is part of the overall software development 
process. When implementing testing automation, it must align with and conform to the project management methodology. In projects using Waterfall project management, 
cycles for development are long and the automation team can plan accordingly. This would include setting up many of the functions and components and building an 
automation framework. With Agile projects, there isn't as much time within each sprint to build out a complete automation framework so alternate solutions should 
be identified.

###Benfits to AF

The AF is continually enhancing, upgrading, and/or replacing software systems and applications to meet mission and user needs. This presents an ideal opportunity 
to introduce test automation practices so that future iterations of the software development process will show greater:<br/>

-	testing efficiency through faster execution<br/>
-	testing effectiveness through additional functional coverage<br/>
-	test repeatability through programmed execution<br/>
-	improvement in timely reporting of system quality<br/>
