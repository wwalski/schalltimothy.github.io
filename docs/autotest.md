#Overview

###Purpose

AF/A4 published the "US Air Force Enterprise Logistics Flight Plan v2.0" (ELFP) in April 2016 and the subordinate document 
"Enterprise Logistics Technology Annex" (ELTA) in June of 2016.  This plan and annex describe the desired "synthesized logistics information" 
future state of US Air Force (AF) Enterprise Logistics in 2035.  BES believes that in order to maintain a path and schedule to achieve those 
long-term goals, a series of enabling initiatives are needed to accelerate current progress in order to achieve the necessary near-term milestones.  

It is the intent of the Business and Enterprise System (BES) to include the resulting Playbooks into the BES Process Directory (BPD) to ensure 
all members of Air Force Program Executive Office (AFPEO) BES, at all operating locations, have quick easy access to standard processes and 
templates for Defense Business System programs.

DoD continues to recognize the need to apply automated software testing processes and procedures in a more consistent and repeatable manner. The 
Director of Operational Test & Evaluation (DOT&E) annual reports dating back to 2013 and earlier, show a concerted effort to improve the adoption 
rate of automation across the DoD. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY 2018 commissioned an Automated Testing Technologies study. 
There continues to be strong interest across the Services to investigate ways in which automation adoption and momentum can be increased. Defense Acquisition Policy, 
DoD Instruction 5000.02 and 5000.75 through AFMAN 63-144 contain language that encourages the use of automated testing. With the move towards more flexible and 
agile approaches to software development comes a greater urgency to implement test automation. This playbook addresses the desire to adopt test automation 
with practical, experienced-based methods and best practices. 

**Automation Playbook Benefits**

-	Defines a common understanding of automation processes and terminology
-	Establishes automation best practices to facilitate adoption by AF community 
-	Explains the various roles needed to start and maintain test automation
-	Defines an overall architecture of automation applicable across projects and programs
-	Helps programs understand how to migrate from manual to automated testing

###Audience

This playbook is intended for those individuals responsible for the management and engineering of test automation. It provides managers with the knowledge 
that will help them support programs looking to implement automation and it will provide engineers with the information they will need to successfully plan 
the implementation of a test automation solution. The approach is holistic in that it broadly defines many factors, not just technical ones, that are 
necessary to understand and apply when moving towards automation.

###Benfits of Automated Testing

An investment in automation can reap many rewards to the test team and overall project. There are primary and secondary benefits to using automated tools.

**Primary Benefits**

The primary benefits to using automation for testing can be summarized as follows:

-	Faster test execution
-	More reliable/repeatable test execution
-	Increased quality from greater test coverage due to additional tests
-	Facilitates testing of more complex scenarios
-	Less error-prone than manual testing
-	More consistent than manual testing
-	Provides for unattended 24/7 test execution
-	Ability to create additional test conditions from single script
-	Reusability of tests within and across test events
-	Ability to test more in the same or shorter time schedule
-	Testing across a variety of software/hardware platforms
-	Allows for the possibility of testing that which could not be tested manually
-	Allows for increased frequency of testing
-	Allows more effective use of testing resources (i.e. more test design, less manual execution)

**Secondary Benefits**

Secondary benefits for using automated test tools consist of support activities for testing, rather than the testing itself. These include:

-	User account creation in advance of testing
-	Database seeding with required test data
-	Creation/management of test datasets
-	Test environment configuration setup
-	Pre-test initialization activities
-	Post-test clean-up activities
-	Automated data analysis of concluded test events

###Project and Program Benefits

The use of automation brings benefits beyond testing to the project and program. These include:

-	Improved software quality
-	Earlier defect detection
-	Fewer defects sent to next testing phase
-	Greater efficiency in accomplishing testing
-	Greater relevance of timely test results
-	Reduced risk of deployment
-	Improved test reporting 
-	Facilitated identification of defect root causes 
-	Reduced test execution cost
-	Shortened test execution period
-	Improved consistency of test executions
-	Better adapted to iterative development where more frequent testing is required
-	Improved feedback related to application quality
-	Improved system reliability through repeatability and consistency of tests
